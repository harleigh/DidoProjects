Contained in this directory are various formulations of the Brachistochrone problem which
are presented in  Michael Ross' text, A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control (2nd edition).

* **terminalPoint**: Here we solve the 'Brach:1' formulation of the Brachistochrone problem.
* **terminalPointPathConstraint**:Here we solve the 'Brach:2' formulation of the Brachistochrone problem,
   which contains a path constraint and two controls.
