Contained in this directory are various formulations of the Brachistochrone problem which
are presented in  Michael Ross' text, A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control (2nd edition).

Similarly, in each file, there is code to run feasibility analysis on the results returned by Dido.

Description of Directories:
* **terminalPoint**: Here we solve the 'Brach:1' formulation of the Brachistochrone problem: start at a point,
    end at a point
* **terminalPointPathConstraint**:Here we solve the 'Brach:2' formulation of the Brachistochrone problem,
   which contains a path constraint and two controls; start and end at a point.
