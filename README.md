# DidoProjects
This directory contains various optimal control problems solved with the Dido software package, attainable from Elissar Global.

The pdf, didoTutorial, is a small introduction to programing in Dido, and goes really well side-by-side to the two projects in the Brachistochrone directory.  If you're just starting to learn about Dido as well as Optimal Control, I recomend starting in this fashion.
